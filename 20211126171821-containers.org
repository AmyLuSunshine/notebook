#+title: Containers


* What are containers?
  
Containers are completely isolated environments, as they can have their own processes or services, their own network interfaces, their own mounts, just like virtual machines, except *they all share the same OS kernel*.

* Containers vs Virtual Machines

- each virtual machine runs it own OS
