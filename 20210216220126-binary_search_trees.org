* What is a search tree

  the key of any node should be larger than any descendent of its left child, and smaller than the key of any descendent of its right child.

* Property

  Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree
of x, then y.key < x.key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then
y.key > x.key.

* inorder tree walk

* preorder tree walk

* postorset tree walk
