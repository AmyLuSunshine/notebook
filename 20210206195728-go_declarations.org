#+title: Go Declarations
#+filetags: :Golang:

* There are 4 kinds of declarations
  - var
  - const
  - func
  - type

* declarations within the same package

The name of each package-level entity is visible by each file of that package.

You can think of it as a long source file split into different fils. When you import a package and compile the program, each file of the package will be integrated into one file.

* short variable declaration

short variable declaration must declare at least one new variable

#+begin_src go
// error
a := 1
a := 2

// ok
in, err := os.Open(infile)
Out, err := os.Create(infile)
#+end_src
