humans are born actors

never trust your friends too much

think in practical term

* A good seducer

** outer directed

e.g. when you go on a date

Inner directed mode: "does she like me", "am i dressed well", "what can i do to impress her".

Outer directed mode: listening to them; entering their spirit; hearing them saying what they're missing in their life, what they want. Based on these knowled, you can reflect it back to them. you can give them gifts, you can take them to places that you're attentive to them.

* Anti-seducer
preaching and moralizing
