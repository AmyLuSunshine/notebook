* Scheduling?

Contorlling the distribution of work over avaliable resources. For example, process schedulers, network schedulers, container schedulers.

* Go's runtime scheduler

- Distributes goroutines over multiple OS threads that runs on avaliable processors.

- Determines the runnable goroutines, prioritize and run them, park them, and repeat.

** M:N scheduler

   M goroutines need to be scheduled on N OS threads that runs on avaliable processors.
