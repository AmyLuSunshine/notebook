Sometimes, you want to change columns' name of a query output, you can use `SELECT AS` for each column.

#+begin_src sql
	    SELECT
	    make,
	    model,
	    round(avg(price)) AS avg
	    FROM car
	    GROUP BY make, model;
#+end_src

* query

  sender, and txhash

  #+begin_src sql
	select  event->>'transactionHash' as txHash, event->'returnValues'->>'sender' as sender from events where event_id = 100000;
  #+end_src
