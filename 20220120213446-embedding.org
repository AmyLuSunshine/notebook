* interface embedded in struct

the struct implicitly implements the interface, so the struct can be passed in any function that takes the interface as a parameter.

* struct A embedded in struct B

B can directly access A's exported field and methods. Since B gain access to A's methods, B also implements the interfaces that A has already implemented.

* interface A embedded in interface B
