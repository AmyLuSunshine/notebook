** horses tools on the farm (resources on the farm)

* Thread - Thread Control Block (TCB)

 - Context (processor registers)
 - Stack
 - Access to all of the resourcess of the thread

** different people working on the farm (execution on the farm)

* Example of multithreading: Word 

** printing job

** spell checker job

** editing doc
   
** auto save

* Thread States/Operation

Threads don't need New or Exit. Suspension is a process level concepts.

** Ready
   
** Running

** Blocked

* Implementation of Threads   

** Kernel-Level threads

*** Different from Kernel Threads (where the OS is threaded)

** User Level Threads

* Programming complexity caused by multi-thread

** Divide Tasks

** Divide Tasks Equally

** Data Splitting

** Data  Dependency 

** Testing and debugging

* Types of Parallelism

** Data Parallelism

** Task Parallelism
