* What determines CPU performance

CPU time = instruction counts * CPI / clock rate

* Wall clock time, response time, elapsed time

Time is the only reliable measure of computer performance.

** CPU excute time / CPU time

*** user CPU time

The CPU time spent in a program it self.

*** system CPU time

The CPU time spent in the operating system performing tasks on behalf of the program.

* Performance and time

Performance = 1 / time

CPU execute time for a program = CPU clock cycles for a program / clock rate

** CPI

Clock cycle per instruction is the average number of clock cycles for a program.
