#+title: Concurrency, Parallelism and Asynchronous Methods

* Concurrency 
  Multiple tasks start, run and complete in overlapping time periods in no specific order.

** Example

   in the middle of frying chips boiling some vegetables.

* Parallelism
  multiple tasks run *at the same time*

** Example
   one is frying chips, at the same time one is boiling some vegetables.

* Asynchronous methods (non-blocking)

  deliver the blocking process to others (ask for something to happen, get notified when it does. Do other stuff in the meantime.)

  an asynchronous call is normally used for a process that needs to do work away from the current application and we don't want to block our application.

** Example
   
   see yourself as a cpu
   you don't want to waste time waiting for steaming a fish (block your process), so you go to fry chips (non-blocking process).
