* Physical Layer

Physical Layer represents the physical device that interconnect computers.

e.g. cables

* Data Link

Resiponsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network device can communicates

e.g. Ethernet

* Network

Allows different network to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.

* Transport Layer

Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data.

* Application Layer
