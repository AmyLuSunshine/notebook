* Types of memory

** DRAM (dynamic random access memory)

   - memory accesses takes the same amount of time no matter what portion of the memory is read.

** SRAM (static random access memory)

 Cache uses SRAM. Cache memory consists of a small and fast memory that acts as a buffer for the DRAM.



* Main memory and secondary memory

  - main memory is volatile memory
  - secondary memory is non-volatile memory and is used to store data

* Priciple of locality

** Temporal locality

** Spatial locality

* cache
