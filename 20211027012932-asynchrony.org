Asynchrony occurs when two threads are running seemingly at the same time

* For example

** A running thread runs out of time on the CPU and a different thread is chosen to run

* Mutual Exclusion Rules

- No two threads may be in *a critical* section at the *same time*.
- When no thread is in a critical section any thread that requests entry must be allowed in without delay.
- A thread may remain inside a critical section only for a small  amount of time.

* Peterson's Algorithm

  - use global variables 
  - only allow two threads

* Hardware Solutions

** semaphore
