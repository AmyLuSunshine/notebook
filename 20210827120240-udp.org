User Datagram Protocol

- UDP provides port information for application connection

- Connectionless: UDP does not establish any end-to-end connection manager to check on the received packets.

* Header

** Source Port

** Destination Port

** Length

length of the entire UDP segment, including the UDP header and data.

** Checksum

- if an error is detected, the segment is discarded and no error recovery action is taken

- Use of the checksum in UDP is optional

- When it is not used all bits are set to zero
