* How JS represents string

machine representations (bits) -> UTF-16 -> codepoint

1. encode the characters in the string by UTF-16, which gives you a sequence of bits.
2. group every 16 bits as a *code unit*.
3. 

String is a sequence of 16-bits value, also called *code unit*, which represents characters from UTF-16 encoding.
