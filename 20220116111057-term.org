* Upstream/Downstream


A (-> request) B (-> request) C

C is downstream dependency of B.
B is upsstream dependency of C.

* Scaling

** Vertical scaling
   Adding hardware

** Horizontal scaling
   Adding service instances, for example containers in Kubernetes.

* Resilience

Always assume your server are certain to fail, and give a solution to it.

* Manageable

A system can be considered manageable if it's possible to sufficiently alter its behavior without having to alter its code. (environment vairables, config files, use some apis [you can config caddy2 via http] to alter system's behavior)

** Maintainablility
   how easy it is to change from inside (code).
