* Fragmentation (computing)

In computer science, fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space, main storage or secondary storage, is used inefficiently, *reducing capacity* or *performance* and often both.

** Internal Fragmentation

   when a program allocates memory, it often allocates more than it needs. For example, memory can only be provided to programs in chunks (usually 4 bytes), and as a result if a program request 29 bytes, it will actually get a chunkc of 32 bytes.

** External Fragmentation

   there is enough memory space for a program, but the memory is not contiguous.
