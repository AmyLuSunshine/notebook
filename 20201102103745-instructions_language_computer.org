* Instruction set architecture
There exists different instruction sets such as MIPS, x86, ARMv8. They are actually similar to each other because they are based on the similar principles of computer design.

ISA is the interface between hardware and software.


* Computer Design Principle :

** simple (instruction sets are designed for simple tasks like add 2 number rather than 3)

** small (the time of one clock cycle will be large if there are more registers)

* Memory Operands
Data structures are stored in memory. Therefore we need instructions that is data transfer insturctions to transfer data between registers and memory.
