* Instrction set
There exists different instruction sets such as MIPS, x86, ARMv8. They are actually similar to each other because they are based on the similar principles of computer design.


* Computer Design Principle :

** simple (instruction sets are designed for simple tasks like add 2 number rather than 3)

** small (the time of one clock cycle will be large if there are more registers)

* Memory Operands
data structures are stored in memory.
