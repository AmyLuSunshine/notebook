* Operation

** Basic Data Transfer

** Reliability

   Sender will assign number to each packet. If the sender does not receive an ACK before time out, the sender will resend the packet.

   Since packet might not be received in a particular order, the receiver will order packet according to the number provided by packets' sender.

** Flow Control

   Receiver will return a "window" with every ACK indicating a range of acceptablt sequence of numbers beyond the last segment successfully received. (not being overwhelmed by the sender)

** Multiplexing

** Connections

** Precedence and Security
