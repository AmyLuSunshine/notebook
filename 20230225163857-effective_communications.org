* get out the hamburger myth

** hamburger 

*** introduction

*** "3 main points"

*** conclusions

* put all the meat up front

once you show the practical thing, you have audience's attention.

* don't do sequentialism

* ramble

say random stuff. this is how people process information. they don't think linearly.
