* Check the max value of  backlight

#+begin_src go
cat /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/max_brightness
#+end_src

Since I am on a thinkpad with an amd cpu, therefore it the folder that contains files that are controlling backlight is named `amdgpu_b10`. yours might be intel something. Here I got 255, which means the interval of my laptop's backlight is from 0 to 255.

* Modify the brightness then the backlight will automatically change

#+begin_src sh
sudo vim /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness
#+end_src

Set a value that is between 0 and 255.
