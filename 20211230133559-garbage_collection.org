A garbage collector cleans up memory that is no longer used by the 
process on heap.

* Mark and Sweep

  - keep track of all objects
  - occationally pause the process
  - mark: walk + mark accessible objects
  - sweep: free the rest
  - unpause the process

** downside
   - pause the process
   - traverse the whole heap
   - leave the heap fragmented
