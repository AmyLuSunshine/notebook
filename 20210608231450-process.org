A process is an active entity, an executing program, which contains a stack, heap, data, and text.

* Process States
** five states model
*** New

*** Ready
    The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.

*** Running

*** Waiting

*** Terminated (Exit)
    The process has finished execution.

* Suspension

- not every program needs to be loaded in main memory
- suspension is the process removed from main memory
- store that process in secondary storage for future
- frees main memory for other processes
- controlled by medium-term scheduling algorithm
- the process will not be aware of the suspension
- some reasons for suspension
  - degbugging
  - long term delay
  - freeing main memory

After considering suspension, there is a 7 states process model

* Process Image - The PCB

** Contents of a PCB

   - Process ID (PID)
   - Parent process ID
   - User ID
   - Registers
     - store data of registers while the process stops running. once the process runs again, the data will load to registers again.
   - Stack pointers
   - Scheduling
   - Linkages
   - Inter Process Communication (IPC)
     - help Processes communicate with each other
   - Resources
   - Memory

* Process Switch

** When does a switch occur:
  - Interruput - A hardware signal indicating that the hardware need servicing
  - Trap - A condition which requires OS support
  - Blocking system call - A request from the process for OS support

** Steps to Process Switch
   - Save the context into the PCB
   - Update accounting
   - Move the PCB to the appropriate quene
   - Choose another process
   - Update memory management
   - Restore its context

* Scheduling Quenes
  
** job quene
   the list of all the processes on the system.

** ready quene
   the list the processes residing on the main memmory and are ready to execute.

** device quene
   the list of processes waiting for I/O.

* Scheduler
  There are two types of scheduler. The primary difference between these two is the frequency of execution. short-term scheduler executes more frequently and fast.

** long-term
   Select  processes in mass storage (e.g. disk) and load them into memory.
   
** short-term
   Select processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them.
