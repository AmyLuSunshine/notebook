A: pri_key_A pub_key_A
B: pri_key_B pub_key_B

if A wanna send an encrypted file to B, A does:

encrypt the file with pri_key_A, then encrypt the encrypted file with pub_key_B.

after receiving the file, B does:

decrypt the file with pri_key_B, then decrypt the decrypted file with pub_key_A (this procesure ensures that the file was sent from A).
