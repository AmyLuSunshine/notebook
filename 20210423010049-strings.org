* How to create a string

** single quotes
   #+begin_src js
   console.log('hello wrold');
   #+end_src

** double quptes
   #+begin_src js
   console.log("hello wrold");
   #+end_src

** backticks
   backticks is called the template literals, which means you can embed other expression inside it.
   #+begin_src js
   console.log("haif of 100 is ${100 / 2}");
   #+end_src

* Escaping
  same as golang
  
* Unicode
  JS uses 16 bits spaces to store a string. But there are more than 2^16 Unicode characters, so some characters takes 2 "characters positions".
  
* Concatenate

  #+begin_src js
  console.log("hello" + world)
  #+end_src
