  Asymptotic analysis is a way to analyze how fast a program's runtime growth.

* key points

** imagine the size of your input grows towards infinity

** compare the growth of the input size and the growth of program's runtime

* Big O

The big O notation describes the "worst case" of an algorithm.

* Big Ω

The big Ω notation describes the "best case" of an algorithm.

* Big Θ

The big Θ notation is employed when the big O and the big Ω of a program's runtime is the same.
