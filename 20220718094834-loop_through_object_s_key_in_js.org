* for in

the problem of *for in* loop is that it will go through the prototype chain.

#+begin_src js
let animal = {
  eats: true,
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
};

rabbit.__proto__ = animal;

for (let k in Object.entries(rabbit)) {
  console.log(k, v);
}
#+end_src

* for of and Object.entries()

when you only want to loop through key of an object without going over its prototype chain, you can do the following:

#+begin_src js
let animal = {
  eats: true,
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
};

rabbit.__proto__ = animal;

console.log(Object.entries(rabbit));

for (let [k, v] of Object.entries(rabbit)) {
  console.log(k, v);
}
#+end_src
