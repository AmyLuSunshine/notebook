Goroutines are not garbage collected by the runtime.

* Terminate a goroutine

** when it has completed its work

** when it cannot continue its work due to an unrecoverable error

** when it's told to stop working

* Prevent goroutine leaks

  If a goroutine is responsible for creating a goroutine, it is also responsible for ensuring it can stop the goroutine.
