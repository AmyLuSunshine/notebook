* Propositions

Proposition is a declarative statement that is either true or false.

For example:

- The sky is blue.
- Luke, I am your father.

These are not propersition:

- Sit down
- x + 1 = 2 (because x is not assigned any value, this statement cannot be determined T or F)

* Logical operators

Logical operators that are used to form new propositions from *two or more* existing propositions.

** negation

NOT

** connectives

*** conjunction

AND

*** disjunction

OR
XOR (exclusive or)

*** implication

if...then
 
*** biconditional

if, and only if 

* Conditional Statements

(1) is equivalent to (2)
(3) is equivalent to (4)

** If p then q (1)

$p\to q$

** contrapositive (2)

$\neg q \to \neg p$

** converse (3)

$q \to p$

** inverse (4)

$\neg p \to \neg q$

* Precedence of Logical Operators

** 1. negation

** 2. expresssion inside parentheses

** 3. conjunction

** 4. disjunction

** 5. -> and <->

* Propositional Equivalences

** tautology

always true, no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it.

** contradiction

always false
