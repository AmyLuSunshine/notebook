* Four layers

  TCP/IP is a set of protocols that are logically seperated into 4 layers.

  - Application layer
  - Transport layer
  - Internet layer
  - Link layer

* Port numbers

  Port numbers are used to identify the process/application on a machine. IP address identifies a host, the port number identifies the process on that host.

* Socket
  Socket is an API for programs to talk to the network. If an application, for emaple browser, wants to talk to the Internet, it talks to the socket API.

* Connection vs Connectionless

- TCP is a connection oriented protocol
- UDP is a connectionless protocol
