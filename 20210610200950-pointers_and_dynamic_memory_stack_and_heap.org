| App Memory    | Usage                         |
|---------------+-------------------------------|
| Heap          |                               |
| Stack         | function call local Variables |
| Static/Global | Global Variables              |
| Code (Text)   | Instructions                  |

the memory allocation of Stack, Static/Global, Code(Text) does not change in run time.
  
the only way to use heap is through references. the variables of references is on stack, but they store the memory address on heap.
